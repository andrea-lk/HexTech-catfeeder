Working on the Automatic Cat Feeder project has been an educational experience. I learned valuable skills in
MQTT communication, GUI development with customtkinter, and scheduling automation tasks efficiently. Integrating hardware 
with software, particularly using the HexTech circuit board, was a significant part of this project. HexTech proved to be
extremely helpful, being very user-friendly and accessible for new engineers, and it allowed for a wide range of creative
and practical applications. With HexTech, the possibilities for automation are vast, from managing tasks remotely to
automating home functions, making life easier. Overall, this project highlighted the powerful potential of combining 
reliable hardware with innovative software solutions.
